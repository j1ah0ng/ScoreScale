# ScoreScale

## Overview
---------------------
This repository contains two ScoreScale programs, one Python and one Java, meant
for scaling of scores to a certain predetermined curve factor at Cupertino High
School. Ask Demuth/Uji/Cheung for the exact curve factor, which will be
dependent on the test.

## Usage
---------------------
### Python
Run in Terminal using Python version 3 or greater. Version 2 is not supported
due to usage of the `print` function.
#### Linux
`./ScoreScale.py`
#### All platforms
`python3 ScoreScale.py`


### Java
Compile and run as per any Java program.
#### All platforms
`java ScoreScale`
